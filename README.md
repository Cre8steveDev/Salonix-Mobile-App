# Salonix - Mobile App

I am building Solanix as a full-feature personal challenge project to improve my skills and knowledge as a MERN Stack Developer transitioning from the Web to building Cross-platform Native applications.

I'm equally using these Mobile App projects to solidify my skills in Design (coming from print and marketing design, venturing into UI/UX Design has been exciting and I'm enjoying it - this is a custom design, as seen below. Might update it more - or not, hehe).
